# BNX-MET-CE

[`BNX-MET-CE`](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/BNX-MET-CE) provides the necessary code and data to run a semi-Markov cohort model
and reproduce results for the comparative effectiveness of BNX versus methadone, presented in: "A decision-analytic model-based 
evaluation of the long-term comparative effectiveness of buprenorphine/naloxone versus methadone in British Columbia, Canada."

# R code modules

The R scripts to run the model and conduct the analysis are organized
into two sections:

1.  [R](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/BNX-MET-CE/tree/main/R)
    contains R functions for core modules.

2.  [Analysis](https://github.com/HERU-modeling/BNX-MET-CE/tree/main/analysis)
    contains R scripts to run all analyses.
